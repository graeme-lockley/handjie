# H3: Multi-Agent Development Framework

## üöÄ Overview

H3 is an experimental, open-source multi-agent development framework designed to reimagine software creation through intelligent, collaborative problem-solving.
It uses a team of specialized AI agents that work together, each with specific roles in the development process, configured through a simple YAML file.

The framework allows you to define agents with different skills and responsibilities (like planning, coding, testing, and documentation) that can coordinate to
solve complex software development tasks.

## üèÉ Running H3 Locally

### Prerequisites

- [Deno](https://deno.land/manual/getting_started/installation) installed on your system
- For Anthropic Claude models: An Anthropic API key (set as environment variable)

### Setting Up

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/h3.git
   cd h3
   ```

2. If using Anthropic Claude models, set your API key as an environment variable:
   ```bash
   export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

3. Configure your agents in `agents.yaml` (see the sample file for reference)

### Running the CLI

Start the CLI with:

```bash
deno run --allow-all src/cli.ts
```

#### Command Line Options

- `--name` or `-n`: Specify a primary agent name (default: first agent in agents.yaml)
- `--model` or `-m`: Specify the model to use (default: claude-3.5-sonnet)

Example:

```bash
deno run --allow-all src/cli.ts --name Typer --model llama3.2:latest
```

#### CLI Slash Commands

While running the CLI, you can use these commands:

- `/clear [agent]` - Clear conversation context (for all agents or a specific one)
- `/agents` - List all available agents
- `/use [agent]` - Change the primary agent
- `/help` - Show the help message
- `exit` or `quit` - Exit the application

## ü§ñ Supported LLM Models

### Ollama Models

- `qwq:latest`: Efficient, fast conversational model
- `mistral:latest`: Powerful, versatile reasoning model
- `llama3.1:latest`: Advanced general-purpose model
- `llama3.2:latest`: Advanced general-purpose model
- `deepseek-r1:14b`: High-performance reasoning model
- `qwen2.5-coder:14b`: Specialized coding assistant

### Anthropic Claude Models

- `claude-3.7-sonnet`: Advanced AI assistant with exceptional reasoning (requires API key)
- `claude-3.5-sonnet`: Sophisticated content creation and analysis model (requires API key)

## üî¨ Technical Architecture

- **Runtime**: Deno
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Architecture**: Agent-based, event-driven
- **Configuration**: YAML-driven agent definitions
- **Communication**: Stateless message passing between agents

## üë• How to Contribute

We welcome contributions from the community! Here's how you can contribute:

1. **Fork the Repository**: Create your own fork of the project.

2. **Create a Branch**: Make your changes in a new branch.
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

3. **Make Your Changes**: Implement your feature or fix a bug.

4. **Write Tests**: Ensure your code is properly tested.

5. **Run Tests**: Make sure all tests pass.
   ```bash
   deno test --allow-env
   ```

6. **Submit a Pull Request**: Open a PR against the main repository.

7. **Code Review**: Wait for a maintainer to review your PR.

### Development Guidelines

- Follow TypeScript best practices
- Document your code with comments and update the README if necessary
- Keep your PRs focused on a single change to simplify review
- Respect the existing code style and architecture
